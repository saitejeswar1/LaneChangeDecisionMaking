# LaneChangeDecisionMaking
 
-	A knowledge base with various road topologies was created to support the ANN.
-	The Knowledge Base (KB) could infer the logged data, create rules, and store them for future use.
-	The inconsistencies, if any, in the KB are detected using the Python library by making queries in RDF.
-	Instance segmentation was used to detect various classes of objects in the videos.
-	Developed a Python API running MATLAB engine to detect lane boundaries.
-	Created an ML pipeline of the above-mentioned functions using FLASK as a web application.
